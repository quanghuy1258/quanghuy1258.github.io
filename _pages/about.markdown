My name is Van-Quang-Huy NGUYEN, a teaching assistant at the Faculty of Information Technology, University of Science, Viet Nam National University - Ho Chi Minh City.
In 2019, I received my BSc degree in Computer Science from the Honors Program at the university.
After the graduation, along with working at the university as a teaching assistant, I continued to pursue a master's degree.
I just successfully defended my master's thesis at the end of last year and am awaiting my degree.
In the meantime, I'm focusing on improving my English to meet the foreign language requirements for PhD students.
Therefore, this blog is a great opportunity for me not to only develop my writing skill in English, especially academic writing, but also review my knowledge in cryptology and other fields.

The name of this blog, Marginal Ideas, derives from a habit I used to have as a high school student.
Back then, I would often jot down solutions to mathematical problems directly on my problem sheets.
Every available space of those sheets was utilized, even the margins.
This reminds me of the famous story about Pierre de Fermat and his last theorem.
Just like those margin notes, Marginal Ideas will become a collection of my thoughts on various problems, a big new "problem sheet".

Please feel free to read posts.
If you have any questions or want to discuss something with me, just leave comments or email me.
I am very glad to answer and get acquaintance with you.

Happy Lunar New Year!\
Nha Trang City - Vietnam, February 2nd, 2022.
